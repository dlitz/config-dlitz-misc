_Description: Automatically patch '/root/.bashrc' ?
 A snippet of code can be appended to the root user's .bashrc file, which will
 automatically load the customizations provided by this package whenever an
 non-login root shell is started.
 .
 If you enable this option, the file will be automatically re-patched when
 upgrading this package, and the patch will be automatically unapplied when
 purging the package.  If '/root/.bashrc' cannot be found, nothing will be
 done.
 .
 If you want to examine the exact code that will be appended, see the
 '/usr/share/config-dlitz-bashrc-root/template' file.
